      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        My career path started at BelGut as a software engineer. Then i
        worked as an engineer-electronic and a system administrator at the
        medical-genetic centre. <br />
        <br />
        During my professional career i created several software projects
        and couple of simple sites. Also i released several music albums
        as a sound producer and composer for different bands and labels,
        created a number of graphic works for music albums, some posters,
        and several of logos for different companies. Besides this i
        worked as a video blogger and made a lot of videos for my YouTube
        channel. <br />
        <br />Now I'm planning to grow as a front-end developer to expand
        my professional skills.
